<h3><a id="Overview_4"></a>Overview:</h3>
<p>A highly motivated bioinformatics specialist with a passion for technology, and a strong background in the life sciences. I started
my career as a research associate with a degree in Microbiology, and I’m now finishing a Master’s degree in Bioinformatics while
I work as the Bioinformatics Coordinator for Dana-Farber Harvard Cancer Center, where I manage and maintain the Plasmid portal (<a href="http://plasmid.med.harvard.edu">http://plasmid.med.harvard.edu</a>).</p>
<p>Now that I’m graduating, I’m searching for opportunities to combine my unique background in the life sciences with my programming skills.</p>
